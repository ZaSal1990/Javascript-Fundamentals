//The freezer at Lighthouse Labs is overflowing with Ice Cream so we need to have an ice cream party for all the students so it can be eaten. But before we can do that, we need determine which flavours of ice cream we have, and we'll need to organize them for easy access.
const iceCreamFlavours = ["chocolate", "vanilla", "cookies and cream", "rocky road", "strawberry"];
console.log(iceCreamFlavours);
let newAddition = iceCreamFlavours;
newAddition.push('root beer');
console.log(newAddition);
console.log(newAddition[0]);
console.log(newAddition[newAddition.length-1]);
